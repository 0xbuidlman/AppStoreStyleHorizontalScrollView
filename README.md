AppStoreStyleHorizontalScrollView
=================================

App store style horizontal scroll view

It acts similar to apps sliding behaviours in App store. There are both Objective-C and Swift version available and they perform exactly the same function, please find whichever you like. However, there may be some inappropriate way in Swift version due to the limitation and bugs.(i.e. using UnsafePointer to retrieve the value of CMutablePointer) They will be modified once there is better solution available.
